# Auditing

You will find the example auditing notebook in this folder, as well as the data generated through the experiment.

## Data

You will find the generated data in the `.pickle` files. You can load them as pandas dataframes.

## Analysis

The analysis notebook is an example of how to conduct 

1. Social Group Substitution Test (using Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test and Welch's t-test)
2. Co-occurence bias score $\omega$ test
3. Demographic representation $\delta$ test, along with some visualizations. 

I have made the codes for these tests available as `.py` modules so that you can use it for replication or apply it somewhere else. Have fun auditing!
